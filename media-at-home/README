===========
Description
===========
Media @ Home is a full on replacement for Couch Potato, and Sickbeard. It is focused on functionality, with ease of use, and a modernized interface. It is written purely in PHP, with only a simple batch script, and .sh script for cron/scheduled jobs.
The goal was to focus the development of this alternative on a standalone item that only requires a basic wamp stack. (With no major extra requirements.) It requires PHP, MySQL, and a web server (Apache, nginx, Cherokee, etc.)
